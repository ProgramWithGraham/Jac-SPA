          My experience as a catering director has developed my strong customer
          service skills. It has also taught me that hard work, meticulous
          attention to detail, and communication, are the keys to great customer
          service. I was introduced to the world of technology and coding by my
          adult children, who have been an integral motivation in my decision to
          change the trajectory of my life and pursue a career in technology. I
          am looking forward to transitioning my love of customer service and
          working as part of a team, into a successful new career as a software
          developer. I am currently enrolled in a highly intensive coding boot
          camp, and will finish my training in a few more weeks. I am genuinely
          excited for what the future holds.
