          My experience as a catering director has developed my strong customer
          service skills. It has also taught me that hard work, meticulous
          attention to detail, and communication, are the keys to great customer
          service. I was introduced to the world of technology and coding by my
          adult children, who have been an integral motivation in my decision to
          change the trajectory of my life and pursue a career in technology. I
          am looking forward to transitioning my love of customer service and
          working as part of a team, into a successful new career as a software
          developer. I am currently enrolled in a highly intensive coding boot
          camp, and will finish my training in a few more weeks. I am genuinely
          excited for what the future holds.

          I started working in banking back in 2007, and since then, I've had
          the chance to develop and deepen my expertise over the past 17 years.
          Currently, I serve as a Compliance Officer, specializing in ensuring
          that both internal and external regulations and policies are followed.
          With the experience I've gained throughout my career and the
          additional skills I've acquired through further education, I'm eager
          to transition into Software Development. I take pride in staying
          informed about the latest advancements in my field and continuously
          seeking more efficient ways to excel in my profession. Transitioning
          into Software Development presents me with a fresh challenge and an
          exciting opportunity to explore creativity and innovation.

          Hello, I have over a decades worth of background in logistics and
          customer service. I am working towards changing my career path with
          the skills I learned from WeCanCodeIt towards being a Software
          developer. Learning to utilize my strong attention to details and my
          problem solving skills through different formats of coding and their
          associated programs. In my free time I enjoy building furniture from
          scratch in my garage for my home and for my friends, maintaining and
          updating my home with different projects, video games, and collecting
          memorabilia.
